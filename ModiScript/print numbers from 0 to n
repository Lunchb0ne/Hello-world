//Printing numbers from 0 to n, which is enetered from the user
Mitrooon
bhaiyo aur behno "ek nambar do"
//Input a number
mann ki baat n
//set counter to 0
counter 0 hai
//Due to the way loops exist in this esolang, loop runs till the given condition is true, instead of the other way around
jab tak counter n se zyada{
  //output the variable "counter"
  bhaiyo aur behno counter
  }
//Show that the loop has ended
bhaiyo aur behno "n tak nambars print ho gaye"
Achhe din aa gaye
